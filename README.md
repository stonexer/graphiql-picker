# graphiql-picker

A demo picker plugin for graphiql.

Online Demo: https://stonexer.github.io/graphiql-picker/

The design of this plugin comes from [@julianbauer
 & @timsuchanek's GraphiQL 2 Design](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/discussions/2216), thanks for the amazing work!

At the moment this project is just for my personal development for fun and may have various bugs and issues. There will be an official version in GraphiQL 2.0.
